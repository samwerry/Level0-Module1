Module 0 Checkpoint

Teacher­led. Before starting, make sure every student has imported their Module 0 Java
Project into Eclipse. Check that all programs are closed but students have selected the
default package in the Eclipse Package Explorer.
Instruct students to do the following ­ check student screens to monitor understanding.
Help students who are stuck, but note lack of mastery. 
          1. Create a new Java class called Checkpoint
          public class checkpoint{
          
          2. Add a main method to the class
          public static void main(String[] args)    {
          
          3. Code a pop­up dialog to ask the user for their favorite color, 
          e.g. “red” 
        String color =   JOptionPane.showInputDialog("whats your favorite color?");
          
          4. Code another pop­up dialog to tell the user that the color they typed is also
your favorite color, 
						JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,  color+ " is my favorite color also");
          e.g. “red is also my favorite color”
          
          
          5. Draw a triangle on the screen using a Robot object (Hint: turn angle = 120).
          
          Robot robert = new Robot
          robert.penDown();
          robert.turn(120);
          robert.move(50);
          robert.turn(120);
          robert.move(50);
          robert.turn(120);
          robert.move(50);
          
         } 
EXTRA: For students who complete activity quickly, have them try to turn the name of
the color into a matching pen color and have the robot draw the triangle in that color.
This is NOT part of the checkpoint!
